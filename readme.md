This is a project called Biker Zone. The project is the outcome of my second practice of using tailwind css framework. In addition I used Daisy Ui (The most popular component library for tailwind CSS). That was an awesome experience. You can learn more about daisy ui here--> https://daisyui.com/


The project is live here:
